# NLP with Hugging Face: A Modular Journey

Welcome to our "NLP with Hugging Face" repository, where we embark on a modular journey through the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Hugging Face, one of the most popular and powerful libraries in the field. This repository is structured to provide both foundational knowledge and advanced insights into various NLP tasks and applications.

## Overview

This repository is designed as a step-by-step guide that takes you from the basics of NLP and Hugging Face to more complex and advanced NLP tasks. Each part of the repository focuses on a different aspect of NLP, ensuring a structured and comprehensive learning experience.

## Structure

The repository is divided into six parts, each dedicated to a specific topic within NLP:

### PART_1: Introduction to NLP and Hugging Face
- An overview of NLP and its importance.
- Getting started with the Hugging Face library and its ecosystem.

### PART_2: Text Classification
- Understanding and implementing text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific text classification purposes.

### PART_3: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Introduction to NER and its significance in extracting information from text.
- Practical examples of implementing NER with Hugging Face models.

### PART_4: Question Answering Systems
- Building question-answering systems that can understand and respond to queries based on context.
- Exploring different models and techniques for effective QA systems.

### PART_5: Text Generation
- Techniques and models for generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
- Customizing text generation for creative and practical applications.

### PART_6: Advanced Topics and Applications
- Delving into cutting-edge NLP research and applications.
- Discussion on optimization, deployment, and best practices for NLP models.
